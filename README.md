# Gesture Gallery Experience

## Project Overview

The **Gesture Gallery Experience** is an innovative virtual art gallery application that allows users to explore an art collection using hand gestures for navigation and interaction. Users can view detailed information about each artwork and rate them, all through intuitive hand-gesture recognition. This project leverages computer vision and machine learning technologies, providing an immersive and interactive experience with minimal hardware requirements.

## Features

- **Hand-Gesture Navigation**: Navigate through the gallery using gestures for a smooth, contactless experience.
- **Artwork Details**: Display detailed information about each painting with a simple hand gesture.
- **Rating System**: Use hand gestures to rate each artwork.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simplified and responsive interface, built with Tkinter, for easy interaction.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Primary programming language.
- **TensorFlow**: For training and deploying gesture recognition models.
- **OpenCV**: To detect and interpret hand movements.
- **Tkinter**: GUI framework to create the gallery interface.
- **PIL (Pillow)**: For image processing and display.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/gesture-gallery-experience.git
    cd gesture-gallery-experience
    ```

2. **Install Required Packages**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the Application**:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```


How to Use:

1. Hand Gestures:
   - Next Painting: Swipe right with your hand.
   - Previous Painting: Swipe left with your hand.
   - Show Details: Open palm gesture.
   - Hide Details: Ok sign/gesture.
   - Rate Painting: Thumbs up or down gesture.
   - Exit Application: Closed fist gesture.

2. Navigation:
   Use the hand gestures in front of the camera to interact with the paintings. A demo video showing gesture interaction with the app is available in the "Video" folder.
